I am not a lawyer, but I understand that there is a slim chance that
these indices could be argued to be derivative works of copyrighted
material.  If so, they are distributed under fair use, given that:

*   the distribution is not for profit
*   the distribution cannot negatively impact the expected revenue from
    or market for the original works (in fact if anything it should
    increase it)
*   the indices substantially less than the original work
*   considerable original effort was invested in creating accurate indices
